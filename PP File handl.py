# File Methods;
"""  Method	                       Description
close()	                       Closes an opened file. It has no effect if the file is already closed.
detach()	                   Separates the underlying binary buffer from the TextIOBase and returns it.
fileno()	                   Returns an integer number (file descriptor) of the file.
flush()	                       Flushes the write buffer of the file stream.
isatty()	                   Returns True if the file stream is interactive.
read(n)	                       Reads at most n characters from the file. Reads till end of file if it is negative or None.
readable()	                 Returns True if the file stream can be read from.
readline(n=-1)	             Reads and returns one line from the file. Reads in at most n bytes if specified.
readlines(n=-1)	             Reads and returns a list of lines from the file. Reads in at most n bytes/characters if specified.
seek(offset,from=SEEK_SET)	 Changes the file position to offset bytes, in reference to from (start, current, end).
seekable()	                 Returns True if the file stream supports random access.
tell()	                     Returns an integer that represents the current position of the file's object.
truncate(size=None)	         Resizes the file stream to size bytes. If size is not specified, resizes to current location.
writable()	                 Returns True if the file stream can be written to.
write(s)	                 Writes the string s to the file and returns the number of characters written.
writelines(lines)	         Writes a list of lines to the file.
